# Etch-a-Sketch ðŸŽ¨

A simple web-based Etch-a-Sketch project built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It creates a grid of squares where you can "draw" by moving your mouse over them.

## Features
- **Custom grid size**: Click the button to choose how many squares per side (up to 100).
- **Hover effect**: Each square changes to a random color when hovered over.
- **Progressive darkening**: Each hover darkens the square by 10% until fully black after 10 passes.
- **Responsive grid creation**: Works with different grid sizes while keeping the container size fixed.

## How to Use
1. Open the webpage in your browser.
2. Move your mouse over the grid to draw.
3. Click **"New Grid"** to set a new grid size.

## Technologies Used
- HTML for structure
- CSS (Flexbox) for layout and styling
- JavaScript for grid generation and interaction logic

## Notes
This project is part of my learning journey in **The Odin Project**.  
It's focused on **DOM manipulation**, **event handling**, and basic **Flexbox**.
